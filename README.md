##What is this?##
Basically v2.0 of EatSleepLift.com. The first and current version is code that I'm not thrilled with, so we're doing a rewrite!

### Why is this open sourced? ###
Why not? Together we can make a better application. I'll just be the one to hose it. Only stipulation is: you can't make money off of it, but feel free to use it for personal use (I'll get the correct license information later). It's also a way of giving back to the open source community, the sport, and anyone that it can help.

### Want to contribute? ###
Do the usual: fork, modify, write tests, issue pull request!

### Where is everything? ###
Anything that's currently being worked on will most likely live in the 'dev' branch. The master branch will hold anything that can be pushed to production. Keep in mind that this codebase is currently NOT in production, which is why master is essentially... empty.

**TODO:**
- write more tests
<<<<<<< HEAD
- use issue tracker to actually add todo items :)
