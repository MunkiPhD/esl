##What is this?##
The current live version of EatSleepLift is closed source. This version is will not be. Once it is in a stable and feature comparable state, it will overtake the live version. The current live version is code that I'm not thrilled with, so this version is open source!

### Why is this open sourced? ###
Why not? Together we can make a better application. I'll just be the one to host it. Only stipulation is: you can't make money off of it, but feel free to use it for personal use (I'll get the correct license information later). It's also a way of giving back to the open source community, the sport, and anyone that it can help. If you just want it for personal use on your home computer, have at it.

### Want to contribute? ###
Do the usual: fork, modify, write tests, issue pull request! Use the issue tracker to report bugs and/or look at feature requests you can work on.

Things you can do:
- refactor the older code to a better state
- write tests/better tests
- generate ways to actually look at the data to get meaning (e.g. caloric intake vs max weight efforts)
