##What is this?##
Basically v2.0 of EatSleepLift. The first and current version is code that I'm not thrilled with, so we're doing a rewrite!

### Why is this open sourced? ###
Why not? Together we can make a better application. I'll just be the one to host it. Only stipulation is: you can't make money off of it, but feel free to use it for personal use (I'll get the correct license information later). It's also a way of giving back to the open source community, the sport, and anyone that it can help.

### Want to contribute? ###
Do the usual: fork, modify, write tests, issue pull request!


**TODO:**
- write more tests
- use issue tracker to actually add todo items :)
